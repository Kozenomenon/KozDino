# KozDino
An Adventure in Mod Integration. This open-source mod uses an auto-register process to integrate with Mindwipe My Dino mod. The dinos added by this mod will each represent a demonstration of a specific integration with Mindwipe My Dino.

## Dinos
- Beast of Burden
  - Trike that uses custom level fields to mitigate specific item weights
  - Uses 'Add Config' integration so custom fields can be handled during mindwipe 
- Lucky Dodo 
  - Dodo that randomly grants prize eggs on level-ups
  - Uses 'Add Callback' integration to override mindwipe functionality
  - Each mindwipe drastically reduces luckiness 
- Mutater Rex
  - Rex that randomly gains mutations when levelled 
  - Uses 'Block Types' integration to block mindwipe usage 
- NottaGacha
  - Copy of vanilla Gacha 
  - Demos integration w/ Upgrade My Dino's Gacha features (HUD, wild inventory taming, reroll resources)
  - Uses 'Add Callback' integration to permanently reduce chance of very rare resourceon reroll
